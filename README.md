# Hamzry Freelance Marketplace

## Valentina, if you're reading this, please share it with everyone on the hamzry team.

To all the members of the hamzry team, especially Prince, I am deeply sorry that it has come to this point. It pains me greatly, especially because Prince had placed his trust in me and my ability to deliver as expected, and I have let him down. I want to express my sincere apologies to each and every one of you. The disappointment I feel is overwhelming because I had high hopes for the future of hamzry and the success it would bring to all of us. I never intended to fall short of your expectations.

For a long time now, I have been yearning for something or someone to rescue me from this agony. Over the past six to seven months, my family has questioned me incessantly, surprised and disappointed by the fact that I stay awake until 6 a.m. and only manage to wake up by 10 a.m. every single day, I spend all that time on my laptop, working relentlessly, yet I haven't earned a single penny during this entire period and I have nothing progressive to show for all the time spent. I can't pay my bills, support my family, or accomplish anything worthwhile.

My default behavior to try and fix my problems myself and my inability to express myself effectively has prevented me from properly conveying the struggles I have faced with my laptop and every other issue that bothers me.
To add to my despair, my hard drive and RAM have been damaged, my charging port is currently  damaged and even some keys on my laptop are not responding anymore, i have to use onscreen keyboard when I need to use those keys. I can no longer take my laptop outside; I'm confined to a single spot in my house, where I continue to work and at each instances when it stops charging I’m left helpless till it comes back on. 

I started this project with only one goal and that is to finish, not expecing that this will ever happen

At present, the frontend alone comprises over 480 files with more than 15,000 lines of code, surpassing the capabilities of my laptop. This has rendered it impossible for me to navigate the codebase and work on my local environment. In an attempt to find a solution, I resorted to pushing all the code to a cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Codesandbox, where I work directly on the browser and run the code there. However, even the cloud IDE struggles to handle the massive codebase, exceeding the limitations of the free 2GB RAM and 4-core CPU gives to me . I had to switch to another cloud IDE, GitHub Codespaces, which provides me with only 120 hours of usage before shutting down for three days.

Some days I contemplate suicide, some days I wish for an unfortunate accident that would release me from this hardship and misery, sparing me the agony of making excuses yet again, especially to be able to escape the weight of it all on Fridays.

This struggle has been ongoing, and the last thing I wanted was to make excuses once more and disappoint Esther. I have exhausted all my resources, investing everything I had including the advancement I got just to keep pushing forward. I used the little I had to replace the damaged hard drive in my laptop and ensured the generator stayed on so that I could continue working. I burn through 1.5 to 2GB of data daily, writing code on the browser using the cloud IDE. Often, when I sit down to work, my mind goes blank. I feel tense and scared, pushing myself beyond my limits, resulting in exhaustion, loss of appetite and fatigue.

Frontend as easy as it seems to meshach is unfortunately not that easy. The work is filled with repetition and you have to respond to every single event that happens in the website , and unlike backend that deals mainly on logic and querying, in frontend you’re left to deal with responsiveness, logic, performance, repetition, handling of error, and keeping things organized as much as possible else if you hit a dead-end you can’t go any further and you’re going to spend twice the time unclogging your code. 

I extend my deepest apologies to Esther for squandering the opportunity she gave me. I am truly sorry to Valentina and Meshach for letting them down. Maybe I am burdened with too many personal issues, or perhaps I am simply incompetent. All I know is that I have given my absolute best, but unfortunately, it has not been enough.

I am exhausted, drained, and financially destitute. All I desire is to liberate myself from this misery. To everyone whom I have failed to meet their expectations, I genuinely apologize, and I pray that you can find it in your hearts to forgive me.

I’ve detached hamzry domain from the waitlist page, pushed all the code I’ve worked on to  the current branch that Valentina has access to and I’ve centralized all the figma files.

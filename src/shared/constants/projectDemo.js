  description:
    "I need someone who is and expert in logo design. some one who can draw exactly what I need for my clothing brand. Would like if you were very proficient in affinity designer or adobe, or what ever software you use. I already have a font that I like very much, but I need the font to fit my Clothing brands title. So I need an artist that can take an existing font and make it exactly the same way for my clothing brand title.
